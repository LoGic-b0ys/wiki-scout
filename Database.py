		This method provide interface to read a database and get the array of it. It didn't provide a column name.
		Instead python hold the result in a list of list so you can access column by their index e.g 0,1,2 etc.

		Parameter:
		table_name is a string
		column is a list that hold the name of column that you want to access
		where is a string that hold the filter

		table_name is a string
		column is a list that indicate the target column
